This project contains data for the experiments from the paper Moneer & Little (2025) Attentional Modulation and Processing Architecture in Perceptual Categorization.

/data/ - raw data files from six conditions
/analysis_code/ - matlab files for running SFT analyses
/experiment_code/ - matlab files for running the experiments
/modelling_code/ - matlab files for collecting posterior samples for each model using DEMCMC
